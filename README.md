# [PenroseCSS](https://github.com/rosalesnikho/PenroseCSS)
PenroseCSS is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.



## Getting started

There are a couple ways to download PenroseCSS:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/rosalesnikho/PenroseCSS)
- Clone the repo: `https://github.com/rosalesnikho/PenroseCSS.git` (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)


### What's in the download?

The download includes PenroseCSS's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
PenroseCSS/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.min.css
    ├── penrose.css
│   └── style.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why Use PenroseCSS?

PenroseCSS is lightweight. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS
- Styles most often used HTML Elements for scaffolding or prototyping
- UI Element Examples & Easy Code Documentation


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. PenroseCSS works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
